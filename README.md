# Gym Pose Corrector

## Overview

The Gym Pose Corrector is a machine learning application designed to evaluate and improve workout postures using computer vision techniques. This project integrates multiple machine learning models to predict exercise ratings and provides real-time feedback based on posture detection.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Loads and preprocesses exercise data, including categorical encoding and normalization.
- **Model Training**: Trains various regression models including Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
- **Data Augmentation**: Generates synthetic training data to enhance model performance.
- **Posture Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV to analyze video input and provide feedback on user posture.
- **Visualizations**: Displays training history and data distributions for better understanding and insights.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes basic tests to ensure data integrity and model performance.
